# MaquinaSencillaEmulator
A simple CPU emulator.

# Background
Back in 2010 on first year of University. At "Digital systems and computer technology" class, we have been exposed to one of the most simple CPU, called "Maquina Sencilla" (Simple Machine) that is Turing complete.

I coded this emulator to understand how a emulator works and to get a deeper understanding of the CPU. One of the main limitations that is has is that it doesn't have interrupts or input/output, so it's basically useless for any real work, but it shows the magic of what a CPU can do.
